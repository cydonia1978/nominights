I wiped away the tears as we turned onto the street next to the park, where the Veril's main military base in the capital had been set up. The adrenaline rushing through me when I saw the checkpoint helped me to compose myself a little; I could not afford the luxury of a mental breakdown right now. I needed to stay alert while I was being dragged away into the General's world--the General who was sitting silently at my side, still too close to me. His presence was all-encompassing, like a black hole, making me gravitate towards him. At least he was focusing on something else and didn't have his hands on me for once.

The street was blocked by a provisory wall reaching up to the height of a human's shoulders, made out of a strange combination of wire, sand bags, and plants that grew in thick and twisting thorny vines over the barricade.

Some of the plants were emitting the strange blue undulating glow that I had come to associate with Veril magic, and I remembered the stories about Sleeping Beauty's castle, surrounded by vines that would ensnare anyone who came too close to them, trapping them to die a gruesome death in their thorns.
